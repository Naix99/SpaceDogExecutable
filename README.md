# SpaceDogExecutable
Repository for Space Dog prototype game

A spaceship shooter game inspired in Star fox (hence the name) and old mecha cartoons (hence the artstyle).

This is a prototype I did to force myself to learn unreal. The game should last less than 3 minutes (althought getting a perfect score a little bit more than that :P )

Support keyboard and xbox control (but mouse in menu, sorry ... prototype things :().

Controls (first for keyboard then for controlpad):

W/A/S/D or Left stick: Move arround.

F/J or LT/RT: Shoot.

K/Q or A/X: Go faster.

E/L or Y/B: Brake.

P or Start menu: Pause.

Hope you enjoy it! 

If having trouble running the game install the libraries found in Engine/Extras.
